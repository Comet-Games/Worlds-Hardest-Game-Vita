# Worlds Hardest Game Vita
A re-creation of the popular flash game Worlds Hardest Game by SNUBBY LAND and Armour Games.
Currently a demo and has limited levels... will be updated weekly maybe daily until finished.

Currently when you finish level 4 you get presented with a blank screen this is becasue it is not finished yet but in the next update i will add a Start Menu and an End Screen. (just exit the application and restart it if you want to play the levels again.)

Inside the Version Folder you will find the different versions of the game and inide those folders is a .vpk file. 
You should have custom firmware running on your vita if you would like to play the game and you will also need to install vitaShell to install the .vpk file.

# Current Features
D-Pad controls only! (Joysticks will be added in the near future!)

Background music and sound effects! (original music by snayk)
